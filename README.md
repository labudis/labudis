### Hi, I'm Tadas 👋👋

I love building products! Currently, I'm a Senior Product Manager at [GitHub](https://github.com) looking after Issues.

_Some of my previous roles:_
- Senior Director of Product at [Playvox](https://www.playvox.com/) where I led a team building a brand new AutoQA product
- CEO & Founder at [Prodsight](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prodsight/). It was a conversational AI startup that was acquired by Playvox in 2022.
- Product Manager at Yavi

I also mentor early-stage founders via [Techscaler](https://www.techscaler.co.uk/).
